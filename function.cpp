# food-delievery
this is just a trial, as I am new to GitHub.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
  
  {
  cout<<"Food delievery app";
  
  cout<<"Hey there i am new to github, and i am looking forward to learn it quickly and professionally";
  
  // this is my second branch and now i want to compare it with my main branch.
